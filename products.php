<br/><b>BENEFITS<br/>
Fleet Management</b>
<br/><br/>
InnovTrack gives fleet owners the possibility to follow the movement of vehicles and goods on a real time basis. The vehicle owner can plan ahead and make work schedules - vehicle idling time is reduced - ensuring better service to customers and increase in revenues.
<br/><br/>
<b>LOGISTICS USE - Commercials</b><br/>

Logistics is all about planning. And planning requires good, detailed and up-to-date information. InnovTrack's management station records all details about the trip of each vehicle along with its speed, fuel consumption, etc. - giving all the information required for effective and efficient operations.

<b>PERSONAL USE</b>
<br/>
Cars are precious to owners. When driven by someone other than the owner, InnovTrack ensures peace of mind by showing exactly where the car is.
<br/><br/>
<b>INSTITUTIONAL USE</b><br/><br/>
A premier educational institution, providing quality education to students around the region. With excellent infrastructure, the school takes pride in providing an environment promoting the progress of the students. The school also provides transportation for its students coming from different locations.
<br/><br/>
<b>Business Requirement</b><br/>
The school wanted a tracking system so that parents and administration could know where their students are at any given time on any of their buses. The school wanted to place top emphasis on the safety of students
<br/><br/>
<b>InnovTrack Solution</b>
<br/>InnovTrack improved the educational institutionâ€™s day-to-day school bus operations by helping them monitor and manage the fleet. With InnovTrack installed in their school buses, they can now easily track the movement of all the buses and also receive alerts for violations such as idling for more than 15 minutes, braking, acceleration and speeding through email and SMS. InnovTrack also makes it simple for the school to help identify misused vehicles, unauthorized trips or entry into areas that the vehicles are not permitted. Additional security measures such as Biometric and RFID integration are implemented to track the entry and exit of students from the school bus. With InnovTrack on its side, the school can now handle parental concerns immediately; respond to emergencies or bus breakdowns by locating the nearest vehicle available for assistance and increase driver accountability. The Fleet Maintenance module is an additional benefit for the institution that helps in extending vehicle life.
